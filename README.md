# TeamRepository
A team repository for The Sentimentalists!

## Who are we?
The Sentimentalists are a group of developers (Ana, Ellie, Jamie and Jyothsna) brought together to create a Tech for Good project for the [Tech Returners - Your Return To Tech](https://www.techreturners.com) programme.

## What's in this repo?
This repo documents all our process - from sprint reviews and retrospectives to mockups, designs and other collateral.

## Where's the app?
The app code is split across three repos:
- [SentimentalistsApp-Backend](https://github.com/TheSentimentalists/SentimentalistsApp-Backend) - our python backend service
- [SentimentalistsApp-Frontend](https://github.com/TheSentimentalists/SentimentalistsApp-Frontend) - our React frontend application
- [SentimentalistsApp-Infrastructure](https://github.com/TheSentimentalists/SentimentalistsApp-Infrastructure) - shared terraform modules and infrastructure

There are a few other repos ([Experiments](https://github.com/TheSentimentalists/Experiments), [SentimentalistsApp_Static](https://github.com/TheSentimentalists/SentimentalistsApp_Static), this one!) which document our process and experiments along the way.

## How can I try it?
The app is built and deployed using AWS and Github Pages - you can try it out at [https://thesentimentalists.github.io/](https://thesentimentalists.github.io)!
