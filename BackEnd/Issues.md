# Issues

**Issue #1 - URL Contains Multiple Articles**
- We need to investigate the possibility of a user entering an URL that possibly contains more than 1 article.
- Example: url = "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12710493/jeremy-clarkson-task-force-fix-a-bridge/"
- How likely is this issue to happen (maybe only on "SUN" website?)
- In case this happens:
   * Reject the URL (how?)
   * Send a message on the screen warning that the link contains several articles?
