    * All code will be submitted as pull requests and peer reviewed by the team.
    * We'll write tests for all work we complete. Tests written
    * We'll write stories with clear requirements, and ensure the work completed meets these requirements.

**3. Code Standards**
- Jyothsna also raised setting some code standards, and we agreed:
    * Using the “If applied, this commit will…” standard for commit messages (e.g.) "Change the background colour", "Fix a typo in the demo() method"
    * Use PascalCase for filenames, repos and otherwhere appropriate

- Ana brought up a number of libraries/backend ideas she has been exploring, including web scraping, APIs that have been looked at, platforms and libraries that could be used for the various processing we need to do.
